title: Inaugural HyBox Post

This may be the first post to the Hydra-in-a-Box blog, but our planning and design work is well underway.  And now with Mike Giarlo joining Stanford as Technical Manager on the project, the team feels complete. We are taking advantage of the fall season’s heavy conference schedule to spread the word about the project and talk with fellow members of the cultural heritage community and the community of research institutions about what they need in a next-generation repository for digital content. 

If you missed [Hydra Connect 2015] ({https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2015}) last month in Minneapolis, you still can [see the plenary presentation] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hnymPvieYeRwdY9mjCFaUXALIRwUQol17og4kdVabWo/edit?usp=sharing) about the Hydra-in-a-Box delivered by Mark Matienzo, project manager, and Hannah Frost, product manager. The slides offer a useful overview of the project background, goals, and collaborative partnership. It also explains key components of our user-centered design process, reveals some of the key take-aways from our summer survey, and outlines early technical planning. 

Later in the same plenary session, Mike Giarlo and Jon Stroop delivered a [presentation on the Portland Common Data Model] (http://www.slideshare.net/jpstroop/a-more-worthwhile-sufia-now-with-pcdm), better known as PCDM, one of the biggest developments in the HydraSphere this year and one that is fundamental to HyBox. These two presentations served as terrific launching pads for the many in-depth breakout discussions that followed in the rest of the week, discussions that are relevant to HyBox and related developments in Hydra generally. It is exciting to see Hydra as vibrant as ever and the HyBox team is glad to be part of it and we’ll be better for it!
