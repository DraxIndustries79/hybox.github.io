This may be the first post to the Hydra-in-a-Box blog, but our planning and design work is well underway.  And now with Mike Giarlo joining Stanford Libraries as Technical Manager on the project, the team feels complete. We are taking advantage of the fall seasonâ€™s heavy conference schedule to spread the word about the project and talk with fellow members of the cultural heritage community and the community of research institutions about what they need in a next-generation repository for digital content.
